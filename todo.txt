# Test notes

zombie puzzle thing on the wall has its image in [REMOVED] instead of the tools prop

haunted's props did not start upon auto start being selected? (maybe)

When viewing room not with prop that was flagged

[prop control]Exception type: KeyError, Error: 'light_maze'
[prop control]Traceback: Traceback (most recent call last):

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^

starting video needs visual feedback (replace video playing icon?)

wrong audio files for time capacitor

# beta to do

tap to close hint, instead opening image automatically on reception with text below it?

manual hint image browser needs a scroll feature (or a browser with thumbnails)

mirror should be a cousin prop in haunted

restart app and restart computer as watchdog commands

bug reporter for users

hint contents
    add images to the manual hint library
    !film video solutions

video solutions will have to take into account cousin props as well

##############################################################################################################################
# todo

increase received audio sample volume for soundcheck

times touched screen stat

increase received audio sample volume for soundcheck

"switch sides" button for prop control

watchdog send errors to admin

"currently displayed hint"
"please select nudge frequency"
auto create folders for hint contents

reboot kiosk application (watchdog command if it listens to message_handler) (or probably listen for such commands as though it were m_h)

rebooter added to kiosk app

make image viewing overlaying everything instead of hiding elements

finish admin_interface_builder encapsulation
    send_hint and clear_manual_hint are still being used directly from admin_interface_builder instead of hint_functions

technician app (e.g "finish all" button)
    play intro button
    reset ALLLLLL props
    kiosk restarter
    soundcheck functionality

kiosk hangup reliability: 
    kiosk doesn't retry/add itself back to queue after failed sync attempt
    kiosks don't always launch successfully, especially after the video feed check
        "Blocking Network Operations (Highest Probability): This is by far the most likely culprit. The code has multiple places where network operations (sockets, HTTP requests) occur without proper timeouts and error handling. SIGINT (Ctrl+C) often interrupts these blocking calls.
        Deadlocks (Medium Probability): The code uses threading.Lock in several places (audio_server.py, video_server.py, kiosk_file_downloader.py, video_manager.py, prop_data_monitor.py). Improper lock acquisition and release can lead to deadlocks. A single Ctrl+C might interrupt one thread, potentially breaking a deadlock, but this is unreliable.
        Long-running operations in the main Tkinter thread (Medium Probability): Blocking calls in the Tkinter main thread will freeze the GUI and can lead to this behavior. While the code tries to offload to threads, some operations still might occur within after callbacks or event handlers.
        Pygame Mixer Issues (Low Probability): While less likely than network issues, improper use of pygame.mixer can sometimes cause hangs, especially if there are errors loading or playing audio files.
        Infinite Loops (Low Probability): Less likely, but still possible. If any of the while self.running: loops have a subtle bug that prevents them from exiting, this could occur."

# ambitious extra ideas:

refill cylinders button
"create popout prop control" (for controlling numerous rooms)
add ways for game masters to enjoyably interact with guests
xyz finished their game (instead of generic victory sound)
kiosk relaunch after sync finish
reset props, reset room (runs reset all + reset kiosk)
windows scaling detection, not having to rotate to landscape
periodic setting of casino/morning after according to room?
"wave back" button
log video solution usage to discourage excessive use
make "reset kiosk" a reliable UI debugger somehow
save props' status for blackbox, delete save upon load
"enable drink menu" by default on
dark theme
hint count on THEIR side
"your host/gamemaster's name" shown at victory/loss(?) screen
LLM translator call
AI generated text hint based on room state
announce to lobby: room states for automatic standbys/room victory/out of time 
mqtt LEDs for GMs to point out items (checkbox on hints, available or not based on "has_light" flag in prop naming json)
kiosk responds to prop finishes with vfx
dark theme
profile creation,
profile deletion (admin only)
save hint to public (usable by all profiles, shown what profile made it, save to own private profile)
save hint to private (local to profile)
save hint to global/default (admin only)
set hint color

prop monitoring functionality prompt:

For now, on the admin side, it need only print every message it receives from the kiosk, but it will only receive such messages when it has asked the kiosk for them.

So, it sends a message to kiosk message handler, and that tells message_handler to tell prop_data_monitor to gather a copy of all the data and send via networking.

it will be up to the admin's network_broadcast_handler to receive and parse this data, again, but that's later and for now it will just print.

The admin will have a file which will contain all of the IPs that the kiosk will need to report its latest data on, so this info will be included in the message sent via message_handler.

Please examine the structure of prop_name_mapping.json. Each item will have added to it (if necessary; some items will not have an "ip" property) "ip". So when admin requests data on props, it will pull all the IPs from that room's props based on prop_name_mapping.json.

set hint color,
hint folders,
clear hints requested when starting timer
restarter moved to kiosk app
last hint given (admin-side)
soundcheck/touchcheck behavior
kiosk-side hint notification sound + manual sound button on admin
video hints need play button
hint text and image need to be aligned
hint cooldown text needs to have background or be universal
room start upon video finish (optional?)
reduce music volume while video hint is playing/have no audio in video hints
alarm "stop doing that" button

# known bugs
some props being pulled over to their non-respective rooms, showing as offline. sometimes the whole prop page remains on the previous room? (may only be when switching)
reset all makes a call for kiosk tracker log that doesn't exist
two gamemasters requesting the same video stream crashes that kiosk
hint cooldown text missing




ambitious extra ideas:
AI generated text hint based on room state
walkie to lobby: room states for automatic standbys/room victory/out of time

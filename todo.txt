# important/immediate todo
outro audio


# planned features: 
admin mode (technician/managers),
clear hints requested when starting timer
restarter moved to kiosk app
last hint given (admin-side)
room start upon video finish (optional?)
edit hint image content within hint manager
hint requested status needs to be tracked kiosk-side to manage multiple gamemasters
ending audio is apparently admin app side?
audio hints need a means of playing the audio on kiosk side
kiosk needs to have as much info as possible in case of admin crash



# known bugs
some props being pulled over to their non-respective rooms, showing as offline. sometimes the whole prop page remains on the previous room? (may only be when switching)
reset all makes a call for kiosk tracker log that doesn't exist
two gamemasters requesting the same video stream crashes that kiosk
skip button starts timer despite skipping only one video
resets during intro videos cause crashing/audio bugs
hint button doesn't update



# ambitious extra ideas:
AI generated text hint based on room state
walkie to lobby: room states for automatic standbys/room victory/out of time 
set alarm on prop to make sound when gm-chosen prop finishes
automatic room restoration for all props upon full pause
soundcheck/touchcheck behavior

profile creation,
profile deletion (admin only)

save hint to public (usable by all profiles, shown what profile made it, save to own private profile)
save hint to private (local to profile)
save hint to global/default (admin only)
set hint color

"stop everything" button
"finish videos" button


# planned features: 
profile creation,
profile deletion (admin only),
admin mode (technician/managers),
save hint to public (usable by all profiles, shown what profile made it, save to own private profile),
save hint to private (local to profile),
save hint to global/default (admin only),
set hint color,
clear hints requested when starting timer
restarter moved to kiosk app
last hint given (admin-side)
soundcheck/touchcheck behavior
video hints need play button
room start upon video finish (optional?)
reduce music volume while video hint is playing/have no audio in video hints
hint manager limited access
edit hint image content within hint manager
hint requested status needs to be tracked kiosk-side to manage multiple gamemasters
ending audio is apparently admin app side?
standby condition for rooms based on prop finish status

# known bugs
some props being pulled over to their non-respective rooms, showing as offline. sometimes the whole prop page remains on the previous room? (may only be when switching)
reset all makes a call for kiosk tracker log that doesn't exist
two gamemasters requesting the same video stream crashes that kiosk
audio props only load on prop-click if prop is not renamed




# ambitious extra ideas:
AI generated text hint based on room state
walkie to lobby: room states for automatic standbys/room victory/out of time 
set alarm on prop to make sound when gm-chosen prop finishes

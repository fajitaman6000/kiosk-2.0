Hello! If you're reading this, this file is both for YOU (the LLM) to gain context from AND for you to write notes into yourself
to help future iterations of yourself to refine this codebase and maintain a central program philosophy.

You are encouraged to put important context notes here, please!



I, the user talking to you, am the lead technician of an escape room. This escape room has a bar. This codebase you see IS that bar functionality.

Central tenants: 

This program is designed to be highly encapsulated with heavy emphasis on single purpose scripts/classes.

The server will be run from ONE computer, the bar itself, sitting on the counter.

The CLIENT, there will be six of, always, each on a low power computer sitting inside the escape room.

The kiosks have an existing PyQT architecture which, if you're seeing this, you likely have no context of. What matters is that the client side of the bar application will
pop up as a window overlay as a child of the main kiosk QT application.




The following will be notes regarding specifics in the code. If you see anything that is no longer true, remove it:
